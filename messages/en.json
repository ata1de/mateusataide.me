We developed the architecture and endpoints of the API, ensuring that all CRUD operations were supported efficiently and securely. User authentication was implemented using JWT and bcrypt, ensuring the security of user data. The final result is a robust and secure API supporting all functionalities of the programming lesson website, providing an efficient and secure user experience."

        "description": "APIs for online learning platforms need to be robust and secure, supporting a wide range of functionalities and ensuring the integrity of user data. Many course platform backends face challenges in implementing complete CRUD operations and secure authentication, which can compromise the user experience. The Onebitflix Backend was designed with Sequelize and PostgreSQL, providing a robust and secure API with complete CRUD operations and user authentication. Additionally, it offers a complete and customized admin route through AdminJs, allowing the client full control over application content and facilitating the modification or addition of new data."

I admit that when I finished, I didn't fully understand everything I had done, but it was certainly the best possible starting point. I learned a lot about Node.js, Express, and Sequelize, as well as gaining practical experience with JWT and bcrypt. The final result is a robust and secure API supporting all functionalities of the programming lesson website, providing an efficient and secure user experience."
